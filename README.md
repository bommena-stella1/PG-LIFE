Welcome to PGlife, your one-stop solution for student housing management! Our website is fully functional and ready for deployment on your web server. 
Please follow the instructions below for a seamless experience:
Based on the information provided earlier, the following tables are mentioned as part of your PG accommodation website project:

1.users
2.cities
3.properties
4.amenities
5.testimonials
6.properties_amenities
7.interested_users_properties
So, there are a total of 7 tables in your project. Each table serves a specific purpose in storing and managing different aspects of the data required for the PG accommodation website.

Certainly! Here's a brief description of each table based on the information provided:

users: Stores information about website users, including user_id, email, password, and other user details.

cities: Contains details about different cities, including city_id, city_name, and any other relevant information.

properties: Holds data related to PG accommodations, including property_id, property_name, address, rent, and other property details.

amenities: Stores information about amenities available in PG accommodations, including amenity_id, name, type, and icon.

testimonials: Contains user testimonials for PG accommodations, including testimonial_id, user_name, content, and property_id.

properties_amenities: Represents the many-to-many relationship between properties and amenities, linking property_id and amenity_id.

interested_users_properties: Tracks users interested in specific properties, including user_id, property_id, and other relevant details.


Many-to-Many Relationship:

In your project, a property can have multiple amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, Power Backup, TV), and each amenity can be associated with multiple properties. This results in a many-to-many relationship between the properties and amenities tables.

Avoiding Redundancy:
Instead of adding a list of amenity columns directly to the properties table, the properties_amenities table allows you to avoid redundancy. Without this junction table, you might need to repeat amenity information for each property in the properties table.

Normalization:
The use of a separate table for the many-to-many relationship follows the principles of database normalization. It helps organize the data efficiently and avoids duplication, ensuring data integrity.

Flexibility and Scalability:
The properties_amenities table provides flexibility and scalability. If new amenities are added or if the list of amenities changes, you can simply update the amenities table without altering the structure of the properties table.

Simlplified Queries:Retrieving information about the amenities associated with a particular property or properties associated with a specific amenity becomes more straightforward with the use of this junction table. You can perform JOIN operations to fetch the necessary data.
